                <p>The end of the year is fast approaching, and it's made me think about 2017 and everything that's happened on this channel. </p>

                <p>Firstly, to be able to work on NODE full time now is a dream for me, and I want you to know that I don't take this for granted, not for a second. This job is the absolute most perfect fit for me, and I feel a moral obligation to not waste this chance.</p>

                <p>I appreciate every one of you who has watched or shared the videos, donated, became a patron, or bought something from the shop.</p>

                <p>It's been a lot of hard work, but I want to work even harder from now on. In a deeper sense, I want to justify my very existence by doing more, and I promise you that I won't stop until I drop dead.</p>

                <p>I also want to say that I feel humbled by you all too. Every time I've asked for help on something, literally hundreds of you stepped forward, and that's a testament to what a great group of people you are. </p>

                <p>So in the coming year, I plan on turning everything up to 11. I've been working on some new video series for a while, many new hardware projects, and I have other bigger plans too, but you will find out about all that in time.</p>

                <p>Thank you.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">GIVEAWAY</p>

                <p>As a small way to show my gratitude I want to do a giveaway. I'll be making some extra stuff from the shop, including the charging keychains, dogtags, watches, multitools, pi zero cases, and more. I also have a few brand new Raspberry Pi 3's that will be included, as well as some new things that will be coming to the shop soon.</p>

                <p>To enter, just make sure you're subscribed, and leave a comment letting me know what you like and don't like about NODE, and what you want to see in the coming year.</p>

                <p>I'll pick a handful of winners in a couple of weeks, and will message you through Youtube. I'll also ship to anywhere in the world.</p>

                <p>Thank you again, and I look forward to reading the comments.</p>

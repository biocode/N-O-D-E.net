                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 57, your look at what's happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. As always, all source links mentioned are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">MIXED REALITY</p>

                <p>Recently Captoglove showed off a demo of their minority-report style controller glove, working with the Microsoft mixed reality headset. If it works as intended, it could potentially be a very interesting way to interface with mixed reality worlds.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">BITCOIN</p>

                <p>A few years ago I wrote about how Bitcoin is a kind of changing of the guard, and how a new wealthy group of mostly technically minded folks could really change the world. Well last week a pseudonymous bitcoiner known as Pineapple, set up the Pineapple Fund, and pledged to donate close to $100million worth of bitcoin to various charities and organisations. Multiple charities have already received funds, and applications are still open.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">3D PRINTING</p>

                <p>Here's an interesting use of 3D printing. Earlier in the year, archeologists used the 3D print of a 1200 year old skull belonging to a Peruvian noblewoman, and used it as the basis for a super life-like facial reconstruction. I wonder if this kind of technique will be used for making surrogate robots in the future.</p>

                <p>http://www.3ders.org/articles/20171215-1200-year-old-peruvian-queens-head-reconstructed-using-3d-printing-with-uncanny-results.html</p>

                <p>In other news, some researchers in Italy and Switzerland have developed the HANDi-Hand, a robotic, 3d printed hand that can be controlled by muscle movements. The cool thing is that all the instructions, 3d files, and arduino sketches needed to make your own are on github.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>Korean-based Rainbow robotics showed off their FX-2 human riding robot. There's not much more information available, but it definitely looks cool. I can just imagine these walking around a rainy cyberpunk cityscape.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES</p>

                <p>Earlier in the month, autonomous racing car DevBot, went up against pitlane reporter Nicki Shields, in a race during the Formula E Hong Kong event.</p>

                <p>I think the fact that this thing can speed around this little street track fully autonomously, without smashing into pieces, shows just how far this technology has come.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C4FJilePPU</p>

                <p>The US Marines have also been experimenting with fully autonomous helicopters. This particular system can convert the famous Huey choppers, and for now is aimed at resupply-type tasks.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>Two new videos this week. The first is a mini-documentary following Jeff Raymond, and his quest to create a self-sufficient farming system, which one day could be used to grow food on Mars.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjoiIEI0pOY</p>

                <p>This next video shows how it's possible to use unmanned autonomous shops and restaurants in Shanghai, and go about your life without needing to come into contact with other humans.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">LAST WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>Last week I showed off the NFC Key, a simple little device which basically adds button switches to NFC tags, to stop them being passively read. </p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOzobRr4kc</p>

                <p>I also shared with you a long term goal I have for NODE, and how I think we could potentially have a big impact on the world. Thank you to everyone who got in touch, I'm slowly working through replies.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWtW9yxVhq4</p>

                <p>Here are the winners of the giveaway I announced a couple weeks ago. I've already messaged you all, so if you see your name, check your youtube messages. I'll get the packages sent out this week.</p>

                <p>Alright then, that's it for this episode. As always, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.</p>
